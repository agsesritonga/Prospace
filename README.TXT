- program's inputs are divided into 4 section:
	1. mapping some string to roman number
	2. calculate string combination based on mapped roman number
	3. mapping string from menu number 1 with some string and credits value
	- formula assumption -> stringRoman stringRoman * stringItem = XX Credits
	- if glob = I and we have this query ->  glob glob Silver is 34 credits, then:
		- glob glob is -> II in roman, in arabic it is 2
		- 2 * Silver = 34
		- Silver = 34/2 -> 17, so Silver value is 17
	4. calculate string based on mapped roman number with some new string from menu number 3
	
- to run the program, there are 2 options:
	1. use the jar, with this command in cmd -> java -jar GalaxyTrade.jar
	2. create new java project in eclipse/netbean with class name -> GalaxyTrade.java, and then copy the source code and compile from the IDE(eclipse/netbean)
